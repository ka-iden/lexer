# lexer

Writing a simple lexer to learn how to tokenize code/statements.  
This is the first step towards learning how to write not only a programming language, but a lexer has other functions, such as tokenising a math expression for evaluation.

## Building

You can build this on Windows using the included Visual Studio 2022 solution.

## Learning Resources

[The Phi Compiler], video devlogs and source code for a token list, and a nice printing scheme for the tokens.
