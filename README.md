# lexer

Writing a simple lexer to learn how to tokenize code/statements.  
This is the first step towards learning how to write not only a programming language, but a lexer has other functions, such as tokenising a math expression for evaluation.

## Building

You can build this on Windows using the included Visual Studio 2022 solution.

## Running

You can either run this with no command arguments, in which the lexer will read from the default supplied code, or you can pass a file name as an argument, in which case the lexer will read from that file.  
The executable can be found in either the `x64/Debug/` or `x64/Debug/` folder, depending on how you built it.

## Learning Resources

[The Phi Compiler], video devlogs and source code. Used for a token list, and a nice printing scheme for the tokens.
